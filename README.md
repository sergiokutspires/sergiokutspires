<h1>Hi, I'm Sérgio!</h1>

<h3>Data Science Student @ NOVA IMS</h3>

<p>
I’m driven by ambition, intellectual hunger, and long-term vision.
</p>

<p>
I care about understanding how things actually work — especially intelligence, data, and the systems behind them. Right now I’m building technical depth in data engineering, AI, and cybersecurity, while figuring out where I want to go deep.

I don’t like surface-level knowledge. I prefer structure, clarity, and competence. I’m still early, but I’m serious about getting better.
